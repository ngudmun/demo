I was working on a website that had multiple developers on it, and it was quite complicated. One of the things that we had to manage was Drupal's config, which is something that can be difficult to get right if all the devs aren't on board properly. We kept having issues where junior devs would make changes on the staging server and then expect them to stay, however the config would be overwritten on every subsequent deploy to that environment. It was causing a lot of confusion within the team and making us lose valuable time (read: client $$$). 

I stepped up and gave a brownbag to the team on exactly what config was, how it worked, and examples on exporting/importing it via drush to make sure we had everything in sync. I also spoke about config_ignore, which we could use for certain items that needed to never be overwritten (staging resources that were different on prod, etc). After this talk, things started going much more smoothly and we were able to just work, not have to fix issues all the time.
